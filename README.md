For specific versions refer: [caretakerd.echocat.org/all](https://caretakerd.echocat.org/all).

## Building

### Precondition

For building caretakerd there is only:

1. a compatible operating system (Linux, Windows or Mac OS X)
2. and a working Java 8 installation required.

There is no need for a working and installed Go installation (or anything else). The build system will download every dependency and build it if necessary.

> **Hint:** The Go runtime build by the build system will be placed under ``~/.go-bootstrap``.

### Run

On Linux and Mac OS X:
```bash
# Build binaries only
./mvnw compile

# Run tests (includes compile)
./mvnw test

# Build resulting packages (including documentation - includes compile)
./mvnw package

# Set the target version number, increase the version number, do mvnw package,
# deploy everything to GitHub releases and set next development version number.
./mvnw release:prepare release:perform
```

On Windows:
```bash
# Build binaries only
mvnw compile

# Run tests (includes compile)
mvnw test

# Build resulting packages (including documentation - includes compile)
mvnw package

# Set the target version number, increase the version number, do mvnw package,
# deploy everything to GitHub releases and set next development version number.
mvnw release:prepare release:perform
```
